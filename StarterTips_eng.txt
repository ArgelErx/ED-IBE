Prerequisites:
	- Win7 or higher, x64
	- Microsoft .Net 4.6
	- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 C ++ runtimes (https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
	- Visual Studio 2012 C ++ Redistributable (x86 and x64) (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679)

	
Quick Guide / Starter Tips:

_________________________________________________________________________
1. Installation
By default, the program installs to half in the Programs
directory (C:\Program Files\ED-IBE) and the other half in the data directory
(C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Local\ED-IBE). These paths can during installation
be adjusted. You also can specify the same directory for both parts (eg. "F:\ED-IBE").

At the end of the installation should go up for a few moments a cmd window.
During this time the database structure is created. If this window does not appear,
something is wrong. Possibly try re-installing in another destination directory.
A log of this action can be found in the data directory, if you experience problems.
(.\ED-IBE\Database\install.log).

If you perform an update the setup routine recognizes an existing 
database by the existence of the file ".\ED-IBE\Database\data\ibdata1".
The database will be left unchanged, unless explicitly wanted due to 
the selection of "Delete and re-create" in the setup dialogs.
Case something goes wrong and you want to delete the database again, you have to
run the installer again and check the checkbox for "Delete and re-create."
But have in mind all data will be lost.

_________________________________________________________________________
2. Start
If ED-IBE starts, the database engine automatically starts, too ("mysqld.exe" in the TaskManager).
If ED-IBE exits the database process is also terminated (exception: the database engine
was available before the start of ED-IBE)

When you start ED-IBE for the first time (or after an update) the master data will automatically 
imported from the supplied EDDN dumpfiles. 
(also see point "3. Export and import of data" -> "Import data of systems/stations/commodities from EDDB-Files")

Tip for this moment: change to your language in the settings.
Sorry, this concerns only the commodities but you're able to 
import in your own language OCR-ed data !

_________________________________________________________________________
3. First steps and results

3.1. enter your own data
After IBE runs and also the right system in the "Current Location" displays
firstly install the "ED Market Connector" (EDMC), if not already done.
The commandline verion of this program (EDMC.exe) must be entered in the settings.
( "Settings" -> "use External Tool" -> "ED Market Connector" -> "a) Path ...")
Now you should be able to read the market data of the current station 
(go to the tab "Market Data Interface") 
by pressing "Landed", "Confirm Location" and "Get Market Data".

* "Landed" + "Confirm Location" also generates a "Landed" event in the Commander's Log
* "Get Market Data"             also generates a "Market Data Collected" event in the Commander's Log

3.2. Starters Kit
If you do not rigidly insists on want to collect only your own data, I recommend
the import of the "Starters Kit": "Data" -> "Import & Export" -> "EDDB imports").
Get the latest data from the EDDB website by pressing "Download latest EDDB dumpfiles".
Then import the data by pressing "Import from downloaded EDDB dumpfiles".
The option "Ok, give me a starter kit out of a bubble ..." must be activated.
Result:
1. you get the latest updates on systems and stations
2. by the activating "starters kit" option you'll all available price data
   out of a bubble around of 20 ly of your current system.

3.3. find profitable route
Go to the tab "Price Analysis" -> "Station-To_Station" and press "Start Calculation".
In the right table you see an overview of the 100 most profitable routes with details.
Depending on which row you select, in the two left tables the commodity data is shown.
So look for the right route that suits most to your needs and then identify
in the left windows which commodities to be purchased for each way (they are also sorted by profit).

3.4. find the next station that sells a particular commodity
Set the "Station Filters" accordingly and then press "Activate filter".
Open the tab "By Commodity" and select from the list the required commodity.
Now sort the table by distance by pressing the column header and search 
the first station, which have a "Supply" or a buy price (Buy). Voila.

_________________________________________________________________________
4. Export and import of data ("Data" -> "Import&Export")

"EDDB imports"
This Point offers the possibility to refresh the master data.
-> At the first start of ED-IBE this import is performed automatically *)
-> During an update from ED-IBE this data is also updated automatically *)
*) using the supplied EDDB dumps, which may not have the newest data
 
You can download and import the latest dumpfiles from the EDDB homepage by button-clicking
(the files will be saved in your temp directory : '.{User}\AppData\local\temp\ED-IBE\')
or do the import by manual appropriated dumpfiles. 
The download function will get files only if they are newer than the existing ones.

By default no prices will be imported or updated. But if you activate the option
you can select between importing a "Starter Kit" (and get the existing market 
data from all stations in the bubble of 20 ly around your current location)
or the full EDDB copy.
Warning: If your database is empty the full import is fast. But if you already have 
much data in it the full import can take few hours to finish.

If you select the "Starter-Kit" the found systems will automatically added to
your list of visited systems (see also 9. "Consideration of systems/stations")
 
"Market Data (CSV)"
Here you can export and import data in the simple and well known csv format.
A good possibility for exchange data with friends.
 
"Import Old Data Files" 
With "Import Old Data Files" you can import your existing data from the old RN if existing.

With "Import RN CommandersLog Files" you can import splitted logfiles from the old RN.
The prerequisite is that the individual files are named like "CommandersLog*.xml".
Multiple import is prevented internally by comparing the time stamp.

_________________________________________________________________________
5. Translations
Under "Data" -> "Edit Localization" you can view translations, edit, import and export.
Sorry, this concerns only the commodities but you're able to import in your own language OCR-ed data !
Also, the addition of another language is possible. For this purpose, export the translations, 
then in the csv file add the new strings then reimport the modified CSV file.
Not existing translations of a new language to be supplemented with the English name
and can be corrected later.

for example 
from:
1;eng;Explosives
1;ger;Sprengstoffe
1;fra;Explosifs

to:
1;eng;Explosives
1;ger;Sprengstoffe
1;fra;Explosifs
1;spa;<spanish name>

_________________________________________________________________________
6. Table Views
By right-clicking on the table header (upper left small field)
a dialog box opens. With this the table view can be customized.

The width of the columns can also be customized by simple drag and drop.
For save the widths open the dialog and simply confirm again.

_________________________________________________________________________
7. ComboBoxes
Although the combo boxes have fixed items, in many cases
you can enter custom values 
(for example you can enter "7" in "Max. Trip Distance")

_________________________________________________________________________
8.  Acessing sql tables directly
At "Data" -> "Direct DB Access" there is a possibility of 
directly depose sql commands. This is intended for debugging and 
for service activities. If you are not sure, then do not put your fingers on it.
It is possible to destroy internal data. 
If multiple commands are entered, a single statement can be targeted 
for run by selecting its text.

_________________________________________________________________________
9. EDDN
The EDDN interface is disabled by default. 
At "Settings"->"EDDN Interface" you can enable the reciever and/or the sender. 
To receive EDDN data automatically at the next start you have to check
"Import received data into database" and "auto start listening on program start".
Please consider also section 9 for understand, why not all stations are shown by default. 

To filter out garbage the time window of valid data is +- 5 minutes. 
The time of your own computer should therefore be well adjusted. 
Multiple incoming data from EDDN  is also be filtered within a 5-minute period.

_________________________________________________________________________
10. Consideration of systems/stations !!!!!!!
For the people who like to reduce the data strictly to the self-visited 
systems (even only self-visited stations) there is a datafilter active by default.

This means even if you get tons of data from somewhere (eg. EDDN or csv-files),
you will not see them - until you have visit the systems OR you deactivate 
this datafilter in the settings.

With this mechanism, you are able to consciously decide against collecting 
price data of unknown systems, but still receive updates of prices of 
visited systems by EDDN (as example!)

Who wants to have considered ALL data must deactivate this filter.
The switch for this is found in the "Settings"->"Data filter".
It can changed at any time will.

Note: If you have imported your old RN data, the list of visited systems/stations
is completed by the data of the "Commander's Log" and the RN-list of visited systems.


=========================================================================

FAQ:

*************************************************************************
Q: price analysis shows no or not enough stations

A1: For the people who like to reduce the data strictly by the self-visited systems 
(even only self-visited stations) there is a datafilter active by default 
(this is also one of the base ideas of this tool - in cause of this it is active by default - yet)
This means even if you get tons of data from anywhere you will not see them - 
until you have visit the systems OR you deactivate the datafilter in the settings.
(Settings => Datafilter)
See also "9. Consideration of systems/stations"


A2: You have bad filter settings (eg. "Distance To Star" or timefilter etc.)

*******************************************
Q: Crash when starting the app ?

A1: Tha database hasn't created during the installation. 
see "1) Installation" in the "Startertipps"

A2: ED-IBE wants to set "VerboseLogging" in the AppConfig.xml from ED 
but has no writing rights in the directory (eg. typical for "Program Files" directory).
Create a second file "AppConfigLocal.xml" and insert following rows (or get the file from "https://github.com/Duke-Jones/ED-IBE/blob/master/AppConfigLocal.xml"):

<AppConfig>
  <Network VerboseLogging="1">
  </Network>
</AppConfig>

A3: The data part of ED-IBE maybe is installed in a directory where IBE has no rights to write someting, e.g. "C:\Program Files\....".
Solution is to install IBE's data part in another directory without restrictions like D:\Games\.." or in the suggested path by the installer.

*******************************************
Q: Crash when grabbing a screenshot?

A1: OCR functions REQUIRE the Visual Studio 2012 C++ Redistributables for BOTH x86 and x64, 
from here => https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679

A2: you're running a security or antivirus tool like "360 Internet Security", "Norton Internet Security" or a AV tool with a blocking funktionality. 
Try to disable this tool (temporary) and check if this is the problem. If so, put "nn_training.exe" (it's in the "\Brainerous" subdir) on a whitelist if possible.

A3: you may already had installed the "Tesseract OCR" before and now the "TESSDATA_PREFIX" environment variable is defined. 
For test this open a cmd window and type "echo %TESSDATA_PREFIX%" + Enter
Solution: copy the "*.traineddata" which is selected on the settings tab (default is "big.traineddata") to this directory 
*OR* uninstall "Tesseract OCR". Be sure also the environment variable is deleted.

*******************************************
Q: Crash when starting the EDDN listener?

A: The ZeroMQ component I use for EDDN listening, require the Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 C++ Runtimes. 
You can get them here => https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784

*******************************************
Q: General bad recognition of digits ?

A: Bad calibration ? Look into the "\Brainerous\images" subdirectory. If the numbers are truncated try to recalibrate the OCR positions.

*******************************************
Q: "8" is often as "6" recognized or other way round ?

A: It's known but there's no solution at the moment. But it should not happen too often -  at most every 4 - 8 screenshots. 
You can try to optimize the recognition if you test other values for "UI Color Cutoff Level". 
Take a value that makes the digits more thinly - [U]but be sure that there are no breaks in the contour.

*************************************************************************
Q: "Current System" is not updated

A1: Check if the correct path to ED is choosen in the settings ("Active Game Path")

A2: There's a second program running which is accessing the logfiles of ED exclusively.
Therefore ED-IBE can't access the logfiles to get the information.
