Prerequisites:
	- Win7 or higher, x64
	- Microsoft .Net 4.6
	- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 C ++ runtimes (https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
	- Visual Studio 2012 C ++ Redistributable (x86 and x64) (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679)

	
Quick Guide / Starter Tips:

_________________________________________________________________________
1. Installation / Update
By default, the program installs to half in the Programs
directory (C:\Program Files\ED-IBE) and the other half in the data directory
(C:\Users\{USER}\AppData\Local\ED-IBE). These paths can during installation
be adjusted. You also can specify the same directory for both parts (eg. "F:\ED-IBE").

At the end of the installation should go up for a few moments a cmd window.
During this time the database structure is created. If this window does not appear,
something is wrong. Possibly try re-installing in another destination directory.
A log of this action can be found in the data directory, if you experience problems.
(.\ED-IBE\Database\install.log).

To update ED-IBE to a newer version simply start the installer of the new version.
All existing data will be taken over automatically.

If you perform an update the setup routine recognizes an existing 
database by the existence of the file ".\ED-IBE\Database\data\ibdata1".
The database will be left unchanged, unless explicitly wanted due to 
the selection of "Delete and re-create" in the setup dialogs.
Case something goes wrong and you want to delete the database again, you have to
run the installer again and check the checkbox for "Delete and re-create."
But have in mind all data will be lost.

_________________________________________________________________________
2. Start
If ED-IBE starts, the database engine automatically starts, too ("mysqld.exe" in the TaskManager).
If ED-IBE exits the database process is also terminated (exception: the database engine
was available before the start of ED-IBE)

When you start ED-IBE for the first time (or after an update) the master data will automatically 
imported from the supplied EDDN dumpfiles. 
(also see point "3. Export and import of data" -> "Import data of systems/stations/commodities from EDDB-Files")

Tip for this moment: change to your language in the settings.
Sorry, this concerns only the commodities but you're able to 
import in your own language OCR-ed data !

_________________________________________________________________________
3. First steps and results

Since version 2.2 Elite Dangerous generates a journal. In this journal file all important events will be written.
(default path is "C:\Users\<Username>\Saved Games\Frontier Developments\Elite Dangerous\").
ED-IBE scans this journal in background and reacts to different events.
As example the "Docked" event is used to initiate the automatic collection of data from the Companion interface
like market data, shipyard and outfitting data. Many of these events are also written
into ED-IBEs "Commander's Log".

Following events are used by ED-IBE at the moment:
Fileheader, Location, Docked, Undocked, SupercruiseEntry, SupercruiseExit, Liftoff, 
Touchdown, FSDJump, Died, Resurrect, Scan

3.1. enter your own data
After IBE runs and also the right system in the "Current Location" displays
firstly activate the Companion interface. For this go to the login mask 
("IO"->"ED Companion"), enter your credentials (for your ED account) and press
"Connect". You'll recieve a mail with your verification code. Enter this code 
in the appropriate field and press "Verify". After a few seconds you should
see in the lower status bar a message about the operating readiness of the interface.

Now you can deal with the interface by landing your ship on a station
 - or if you want to re-collect some data - by pressing "Re-collect station data".

If landing
- you recieve the data from the FD servers
- a "Visited" or "Market Data Collected"-Event is written in the Commander's Log
- the market data of the current station is added to your local database
- ED-IBE will send outfitting and shipyard data to the EDDN (if activated)
- ED-IBE will send market data to the EDDN (if activated) 

The "cached" timer shows how long you will get the data from a internal cache of the interface.
The next request to the ED server will not send until the timer is 0 again. 

3.1.1 what do the leds mean
* Docked: IBE knows that you are docked
* Market Data: (left LED ) the market data of this station are saved into your local database
               (right LED ) IBE has transmitted the market data of this station to EDDN
* Outfitting Data : (left LED ) IBE has recieved the outfitting data of this station (no IBE support yet)
                    (right LED ) IBE has transmitted the outfitting data of this station to EDDN
* Shipyard Data :   (left LED ) IBE has recieved the shipyard data of this station (no IBE support yet)
                    (right LED ) IBE has transmitted the the shipyard data  of this station to EDDN

a led is red: this data was awaited (due to EDDB data) but not recieved from the FD servers
					
3.2. Starters Kit
If you do not rigidly insists on want to collect only your own data, I recommend
the import of the "Starters Kit": "Data" -> "Import & Export" -> "EDDB imports").
Get the latest data from the EDDB website by pressing "Download latest EDDB dumpfiles".
Then import the data by pressing "Import from downloaded EDDB dumpfiles".
The option "Ok, give me a starter kit out of a bubble ..." must be activated.
Result:
1. you get the latest updates on systems and stations
2. by the activating "starters kit" option you'll all available price data
   out of a bubble within 20 ly of your current system.

3.3. find profitable route
Go to the tab "Price Analysis" -> "Station-To_Station" and press "Start Calculation".
("Type"="round trip" should be set)
In the right table you see an overview of the 100 most profitable routes with details.
Depending on which row you select, in the two left tables the commodity data is shown.
So look for the right route that suits most to your needs and then identify
in the left windows which commodities to be purchased for each way (they are also sorted by profit).

3.4. find the next station that sells a particular commodity
Set the "Station Filters" accordingly and then press "Activate filter".
Open the tab "By Commodity" and select from the list the required commodity.
Now sort the table by distance by pressing the column header and search 
the first station, which have a "Supply" or a buy price (Buy). Voila.

3.5. find profitable route "extended" (eg. for Trading-CGs)
For community goals there's often the requirement to trade only with a single particular station.
For this you can fix the currently selected "Station 1" with the checkbox "Fix Station".
From now you get only routes which include this station. 

In addition you can activate a filter to consider only specific commodities
in a specific direction. Eg. if you need to buy "Gallium" und "Indium" 
for selling it on "Station 1",you have to set the buy filter for "Station 2" to 
"Gallium" und "Indium". Now you get only routes with stations which can supply 
at least one these both commodities.

3.6. find next profitable destination "one way" ("wild trader")
As alternative to "fix" you can also enable "current". In opposite to fix
now always the current station (where you've been docked) is your fixed start station.
If you also set "Type" to "one way" you will follow a previously unknown route 
(... like a kind of wild trader ;) ) After each docking you will get a new destination.
Attention: The newer the prices, the better the results.
Just try it or play around with the "max age"-filter.
PS: if "Type" is set to "one way" the commodity filters for station 2 are ignored.

___________________________________________
4. Export and import of data ("Data" -> "Import&Export")

"EDDB imports"
This Point offers the possibility to refresh the master data.
-> At the first start of ED-IBE this import is performed automatically *)
-> During an update from ED-IBE this data is also updated automatically *)
*) using the supplied EDDB dumps, which may not have the newest data
 
You can download and import the latest dumpfiles from the EDDB homepage by button-clicking
(the files will be saved in your temp directory : '.{User}\AppData\local\temp\ED-IBE\')
or do the import by manual appropriated dumpfiles. 
The download function will get files only if they are newer than the existing ones.

By default no prices will be imported or updated. But if you activate the option
you can select between importing a "Starter Kit" (and get the existing market 
data from all stations in the bubble of 20 ly around your current location)
or the full EDDB copy.
Warning: If your database is empty the full import is fast. But if you already have 
much data in it the full import can take few hours to finish.

If you select the "Starter-Kit" the found systems will automatically added to
your list of visited systems (see also 9. "Consideration of systems/stations")
 
"Market Data (CSV)"
Here you can export and import data in the simple and well known csv format.
A good possibility for exchange data with friends.
 
"Import Old Data Files" 
With "Import Old Data Files" you can import your existing data from the old RN if existing.

With "Import RN CommandersLog Files" you can import splitted logfiles from the old RN.
The prerequisite is that the individual files are named like "CommandersLog*.xml".
Multiple import is prevented internally by comparing the time stamp.

"Delete Market Data Older than"
Here you can delete old market data. 

"Delete no longer existing commodity data"
Here you can delete commodities from stations if they are not longer beeing traded.
All market data who are older than <n> days  based on the latest update of the station will be deleted.
This filtering will be done automatically  after every price import for a station, if you have checked the box.

"Companion IDs"
The identification of data from and to the EDDN is now based on the ids, coming from the companion interface.
To get the latest version you can download and import these here.
This update will be done automatically on every start of ED-IBE, if you have checked the box.

4.1 Export a list of visited systems for import into E:D
Since v2.2 Elite Dangerous offers the possibilty to import a list of visited systems.
ED-IBE can export it's own list of visited systems and provide this list for E:D. 
(Menu "Data"->"Export list of visited systems")
More information can be found here: https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php/291643-The-Visited-Stars-cache

_________________________________________________________________________
5. Translations
Under "Data" -> "Edit Localization" you can view translations, edit, import and export.
Sorry, this concerns only the commodities but you're able to import in your own language OCR-ed data !
Also, the addition of another language is possible. For this purpose, export the translations, 
then in the csv file add the new strings then reimport the modified CSV file.
Not existing translations of a new language to be supplemented with the English name
and can be corrected later.

for example 
from:
1;eng;Explosives
1;ger;Sprengstoffe
1;fra;Explosifs

to:
1;eng;Explosives
1;ger;Sprengstoffe
1;fra;Explosifs
1;spa;<spanish name>

5.1 Groupbox "Assign self-added items to EDDB items"
If you get new commodities ( = "self-added items", identifiably on the negative id)
wrongly, you can correct this here. This can happen if you import prices with commodity names
in a non-english language and these names are not linked yet with it's english name (which is the reference).
To correct this you need to select the row with the non-english name from right table (negative id) 
and the appropriate row from right table (positive id). Now press "Confirm Translation" to assign
the non-englisch name with the appropriate commodity ( = well-known EDDB item). All so far collected prices 
will also transmitted to the appropriate commodity and be considered in future price analysis.
(changes will have affect after "Save Changes")

5.2 Groupbox "Correct misspelled commodities"
If you get new commodities ( = "self-added items", identifiably on the negative id)
in cause of misspelled names, you can correct this here. This can happen if you import 
e.g. data from a OCR or they may come with EDDN. To correct this you need to select the row 
with the misspelled name from right table (negative id) and the appropriate row from right table (positive id). 
Now press "Assigne to existing" to transmit the prices to the appropriate commodity ( = well-known EDDB item). 
All so far collected prices will be considered in future price analysis. (changes will have affect after "Save Changes")
(!)Doing this way you will see a messagebox when you save the changes. If you confirm it with "yes"
the misspelled name will be added to a mapping table. Through that the next time this wrong name
it will be automatically corrected.

_________________________________________________________________________
6. Table Views
By right-clicking on the table header (upper left small field)
a dialog box opens. With this the table view can be customized.

The width of the columns can also be customized by simple drag and drop.
For save the widths open the dialog and simply confirm again.

Most tables show a context menu if you click them with the right mouse button.
There you can copy e. g. the system name into the clipboard to post it to the 
E:D system map.

The table of the commander's log has additional context menus.
So you can upload old entries to the EDSM (Elite Dangerous Starmap, https://www.edsm.net/)
or you can force a recalculation of jump distances.
_________________________________________________________________________
7. ComboBoxes
Although the combo boxes have fixed items, in many cases
you can enter custom values 
(for example you can enter "7" in "Max. Trip Distance")

_________________________________________________________________________
8.  Acessing sql tables directly
At "Data" -> "Direct DB Access" there is a possibility of 
directly depose sql commands. This is intended for debugging and 
for service activities. If you are not sure, then do not put your fingers on it.
It is possible to destroy internal data. 
If multiple commands are entered, a single statement can be targeted 
for run by selecting its text.

_________________________________________________________________________
9. EDDN
By default the EDDN interface is sending only outfitting data and shipyard data to the EDDN.
The market data is only transmitted, if the checkbox "Send To EDDN" (below the "Import Market Data" Button)
is checked. In the EDDN settings you can set a default behaviour of the checkbox 
("default is checked" / "default is unchecked" / "hold last setting").
You can find the description of the LEDs in section 3.1.1. 

The recieving of EDDN market data is off by default, but you can activate this at any time will 
in "IO"->"EDDN Interface". To receive EDDN data automatically at the next start you have to check
"Import received data into database" and "auto start listening on program start".

To filter out garbage the time window of valid data is +- 5 minutes. 
The time of your own computer should therefore be well adjusted. 
Multiple incoming data from EDDN  is also be filtered within a 5-minute period.

ED-IBE also sends data about star systems, stations and planets into the EDDN 
(by the events "Docked", "FSDJump" and "Scan", see http://edcodex.info/?m=doc). 
This data is used by different locations, as example z.B. EDDB (www.eddb.io), 
to collect data from the ED universe and to provide the information to the community.

_________________________________________________________________________
10. EDSM
ED-IBE supports to feed your EDSM account with data 
(Elite Dangerous Starmap, https://www.edsm.net/).
After every jump you will see a new entry in your EDSM log.
As premise you need to have a EDSM account and filled your 
personal data in the EDSM window (menu "IO"->"EDSM")

To upload your history from your ED-IBE commanders log
open the context menu mit a rifght mouse click on the rows.


_________________________________________________________________________
11. Consideration of systems/stations 
For the people who like to reduce the data strictly to the self-visited 
systems (even only self-visited stations) there is the possibility to 
activate a datafilter .

This means even if you get tons of data from somewhere (eg. EDDN or csv-files),
you will not see them - until you have visit the systems OR you deactivate 
this datafilter in the settings.

With this mechanism, you are able to consciously decide against collecting 
price data of unknown systems, but still receive updates of prices of 
visited systems by EDDN (as example!)

Who wants to have considered ALL data must deactivate this filter.
The switch for this is found in the "Settings"->"Data filter".
It can changed at any time will.

Note: If you have imported your old RN data, the list of visited systems/stations
is completed by the data of the "Commander's Log" and the RN-list of visited systems.


=========================================================================

FAQ:

*************************************************************************
Q: price analysis shows no or not enough stations

A1: For the people who like to reduce the data strictly by the self-visited systems 
(even only self-visited stations) there can be activated a datafilter 
This means even if you get tons of data from anywhere you will not see them - 
until you have visit the systems OR you deactivate the datafilter in the settings.
(Settings => Datafilter)
See also "10. Consideration of systems/stations"


A2: You have bad filter settings (eg. "Distance To Star" or timefilter etc.)

*******************************************
Q: Crash when starting the app ?

A1: Tha database hasn't created during the installation. 
see "1) Installation" in the "Startertipps"

A2: ED-IBE wants to set "VerboseLogging" in the AppConfig.xml from ED 
but has no writing rights in the directory (eg. typical for "Program Files" directory).
Create a second file "AppConfigLocal.xml" and insert following rows (or get the file from "https://github.com/Duke-Jones/ED-IBE/blob/master/AppConfigLocal.xml"):

<AppConfig>
  <Network VerboseLogging="1">
  </Network>
</AppConfig>

A3: The data part of ED-IBE maybe is installed in a directory where IBE has no rights to write someting, e.g. "C:\Program Files\....".
Solution is to install IBE's data part in another directory without restrictions like D:\Games\.." or in the suggested path by the installer.

A4: The installation path is too long. 
If the path to the sqlserver's ini file is too long, the server won't start.
Already a length of 83 characters has turned out to be too long.

*******************************************
Q: Crash when grabbing a screenshot?

A1: OCR functions REQUIRE the Visual Studio 2012 C++ Redistributables for BOTH x86 and x64, 
from here => https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679

A2: you're running a security or antivirus tool like "360 Internet Security", "Norton Internet Security" or a AV tool with a blocking funktionality. 
Try to disable this tool (temporary) and check if this is the problem. If so, put "nn_training.exe" (it's in the "\Brainerous" subdir) on a whitelist if possible.

A3: you may already had installed the "Tesseract OCR" before and now the "TESSDATA_PREFIX" environment variable is defined. 
For test this open a cmd window and type "echo %TESSDATA_PREFIX%" + Enter
Solution: copy the "*.traineddata" which is selected on the settings tab (default is "big.traineddata") to this directory 
*OR* uninstall "Tesseract OCR". Be sure also the environment variable is deleted.

*******************************************
Q: Crash when starting the EDDN listener?

A: The ZeroMQ component I use for EDDN listening, require the Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 C++ Runtimes. 
You can get them here => https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40784

*******************************************
Q: General bad recognition of digits ?

A: Bad calibration ? Look into the "\Brainerous\images" subdirectory. If the numbers are truncated try to recalibrate the OCR positions.

*******************************************
Q: "8" is often as "6" recognized or other way round ?

A: It's known but there's no solution at the moment. But it should not happen too often -  at most every 4 - 8 screenshots. 
You can try to optimize the recognition if you test other values for "UI Color Cutoff Level". 
Take a value that makes the digits more thinly - [U]but be sure that there are no breaks in the contour.

*************************************************************************
Q: "Current System" is not updated

A1: Check if the correct path to ED is choosen in the settings ("Active Game Path")

A2: There's a second program running which is accessing the logfiles of ED exclusively.
Therefore ED-IBE can't access the logfiles to get the information.
