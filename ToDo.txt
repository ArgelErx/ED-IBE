Needed for development:

- VS2013
- dotNet 4.6 (and 4.6 targeting pack) (http://getdotnet.azurewebsites.net/target-dotnet-platforms.html#)
- MySQL for Visual Studio and MySQL Workbench (over MySQL Installer http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/mysql-installer-for-windows.htmlvisual)

Establish a data-connection in Visual Studio:
1. create a new database : start script "create.cmd" in ".\RNDatabase\Database\script\"
   (leave the second cmd window open - it's the server process).
   Datafiles will be created in ".\RNDatabase\Database\data\"

-  test it with "MySQL Workbench" 
   * add a new connection (hostname = localhost, port 3306, username = root, pw = EliteAdmin ).
     If you can connect everything is fine :-) .

   * if you open the connection in "MySQL Workbench" you can explorer the data structure,
     select data from the tables (at the moment most tables are still empty) 
	 and many other things

   * if you open "\RNDatabase\SQL-Model\Elite_DB.mwb" you see
     the database structure which is created by "create.cmd" and "create_Elite_DB.sql"  

	 (btw: the content of "create_Elite_DB.sql" comes from "Elite_DB.mwb". Open it and
	 enter "Database->Forward Engineer", select the connection -> go on with "next" until 
	 "Review the SQL Script to be Executed". Here you can "Copy to Clipboard" and ..... 
	 you have the content of the file "create_Elite_DB.sql" :-) )

2. establish the connection in the VS project
   * goto Server-Explorer and add a new connection.
     Select "MySQL Database" ("MySQL for Visual Studio" required) and the set 
	 "Servername = localhost, User=root, pass = EliteAdmin".
	 Select "elite_db" as database.
     Thats it - now you can use the structures from the DB in the project.
        
		
Other hints: 		

*  "start_server.cmd" in ".\RNDatabase\Database\script\"
   RN starts the db process itself. But you can also start the db process
   manually by running this script.

*  if you want to recreate the database from scratch you can use 
   the script "create.cmd" in ".\RNDatabase\Database\script\" again.
   It will recreate the whole database. All old data will be gone.

   optional parameters for create.cmd:

   /forceinstall (must be first parameter):
       don't ask the user for overwriting a existing database (for InnoSetup)
   <second parameter> (for Innosetup): 
       path to destination directory fpr the data-structure 

   <third parameter> (for Innosetup): 
       path to program directory for acessing the MySQL binaries
   
   examples:
     for developing : in a cmd goto script directory and start "create.cmd"
	 for installer  : create.cmd /forceinstall "F:\ED-IBE" "F:\Program Files\ED-IBE"
   

*  for creating a installer package use InnoSetup


*****************************************************************************************   
*****************************************************************************************
*****************************************************************************************

todo:
   * option "take jumps into account"
   * Cmdrs Log must using ED-Time
   * single station/time export
   * english data base with possibility of import (file/ocr) from other languages
   * if theres a comodity with a warnlevel of -1 found in a station 
     so ask the user to set currnet values
   * new commodity added and looking on the warn levels (small form) results in crash
   * commodity selection is resetted if changing the system distance filter
   * if implausibe prices show warnlevel direct under the price data
   * show hint with age of market prices if location is a station
   * add rejected marketdata from eddn with rightclick contextmenue
   * show the stations as a one look list
   * more user friendly UI

   * Add outfitting info
   * Add Rare Tab
   * add coordinate calculation for new star systems
   * show hint (new star system, changed data, original data)
   * default setting for new systems
